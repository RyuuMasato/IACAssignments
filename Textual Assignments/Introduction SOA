Glossary for Git

Commit:

As a noun:
A single point in the Git history; the entire history of a project is represented as a set of interrelated commits.
The word "commit" is often used by Git in the same places other revision control systems use the words "revision" or
"version". Also used as a short hand for commit object.

As a verb:
The action of storing a new snapshot of the project’s state in the Git history, by creating a new commit representing
the current state of the index and advancing HEAD to point at the new commit.


Push:

Pushing a branch means to get the branch’s head ref from a remote repository, find out if it is a direct ancestor to the
branch’s local head ref, and in that case, putting all objects, which are reachable from the local head ref, and which
are missing from the remote repository, into the remote object database, and updating the remote head ref. If the
remote head is not an ancestor to the local head, the push fails.

Pull:

Pulling a branch means to fetch it and merge it.

Merge:

As a verb: To bring the contents of another branch (possibly from an external repository) into the current branch. In
the case where the merged-in branch is from a different repository, this is done by first fetching the remote branch and
then merging the result into the current branch. This combination of fetch and merge operations is called a pull.
Merging is performed by an automatic process that identifies changes made since the branches diverged, and then applies
all those changes together. In cases where changes conflict, manual intervention may be required to complete the merge.

As a noun: unless it is a fast-forward, a successful merge results in the creation of a new commit representing the
result of the merge, and having as parents the tips of the merged branches. This commit is referred to as a
"merge commit", or sometimes just a "merge".
